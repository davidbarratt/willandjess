                                                <p>
                                                    Well, the way that Will and I first met was on the first day of school in the sixth grade. He was actually the first person to talk to me there, and I remember lunchtime on that day when he introduced me to a girl named Stephanie. When she walked off from the lunch table, I told her that I thought she was pretty and that I thought I liked her.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Little did I know that moment that at the time he had a crush on her as well that had lasted years of knowing her.
                                                </p>

                                                    Obviously, as time passed on, that crush, on both of our parts, met its end, but as it would turn out, the entire basis of our friendship started on a competition to woo the same girl.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    I’m also supposed to tell a story of an adventure that the two of us have shared. There are too many to choose one to necessarily be my favorite, but here is a story of an adventure that has always stuck with me and that I would gladly organize and go through again and again:
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    During the summer of our freshman year in high school, Will and I packed up our bags and embarked on a fourteen‐day vacation with his nana to beautiful Myrtle Beach. After a long seven hour drive, filled with I‐Spy games and melodic indulgences, we arrived at the condo for a much anticipated view of the South Carolina sand and salt water; and, of course, the speciation of the other beach‐goers.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Soon after our arrival, we went to the closest surf shop to purchase boogie boards, with which we so righteously rode waves on, on almost a daily basis.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    On the close of the days that we would ride those gigantic, and sometimes, dangerous swells, fighting for our lives and the respect of our fellow surfers, we felt the urge to kick back and relax. So, accordingly, we decided to dig in and pile up wet sand in order to fashion a couple of make‐shift Lazy Boy recliners. From atop our gritty beach thrones, we comfortably enjoyed the sun descending over the water line... at least, until the tide came in. At which point, we enjoyed a sit and a swim.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    On most nights, once the sun went down, we enjoyed the condo’s exterior hot tub, accompanied by my guitar and the occasional new friend and music lover.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Other evenings, we would enjoy manipulating a few games of putt‐putt at the local arcade.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    For days, the wave catching, relaxing, and other unmentionable antics bonded a friendship between the two of us that would prove to stand the test of time and the obstacles of distances.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    As Will opens a new chapter in his life, becoming a half of a whole with the woman destined to hold the tile of his best friend, he will always be rich with not only my friendship, but many others also. With his rich past, and Jessica’s rich past,the two of them, together, are destined for a rich future as a couple. They have my love and support, prayers and blessings, and best wishes and congratulations.

Only because we knew we were about to sneak away to go enjoy a meal at one of the greatest restaurants known to man.. Tibbys. Will took David and I there and we all fell in love.. We enjoyed the food too. I remember after the first time we ate there we were giddy, and we promised not to tell anyone about the treasure we had found. That was a mistake made in the mid 1800's in California that we were not about to repeat. Well I guess in writing this I just told a lot of people... O well. 'If God is willing and da creek don't rise.'"

                                                <p>
                                                    The first time I met Will “Branden with an E”, was the Fourth Grade. I was changing from home school and the ever imprisonment trying to learn what long division was while my mother watched Regis and Kathy Lee. Yes, my teacher was more involved with Regis Philbin then she was with my arithmetic skills. My system was in shock from being at a real school for the first time and actually being around people, and we hadn’t even pulled out our math books yet. Eventually doom and gloom happened and we started math and having to solve problems on the board while everyone else seemed to know what they were doing, I was more lost than Branden’s sexuality. The worst part was my teacher didn’t change; my mother took the teaching job for the fourth grade class. I guess either she didn’t remember that math was something she never taught me or there was a math class hidden within Regis and Kathy Lee. I’m still looking for the math episode; I’m starting to think it doesn’t exist. After math was my favorite subject, History. After taking a pop quiz in our history class the first person in my class spoke to me. Branden leaned over and saw that I made a 100 on my quiz and said, 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    “Your pretty good at this.”
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    “I like history, but I have no clue what I’m doing in math.”
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    And that’s when Branden offered the deal that started our friendship. He asked me, 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    “If you help me with history, I’ll help you with math.” 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    That was the beginning of the friendship that has lasted for 14 years. We went through middle school and high school together. You were always there for me and when some of my friends left my side because of the issues I had “sorry other Brandon”, you were always there. You have truly been a great friend to me. Our friendship has spanned from Florida, Hawaii, and Iraq… twice. Even though we haven’t seen each other as much as we both have liked the past six years, I will always remember the night drives, long talks late at night on the beach about what we wanted in our future, The O.C., and the time we had to pull Matt and Keilan out of the ditch and then duct tape the T-Bird front bumper hoping that Mr. Shuler wouldn’t notice. I am happy that you have finally found your one. Can’t wait to see you. And next time you spell my name wrong I will throw a knife at you.

                                                    I remember first meeting will when he pledged Kappa Upsilon Chi. I remember him pledging with Josh & Matt Furlong's pledge class, and then dropping, which made me sad. :( But the next semester, he was back! :) In KYX, like most fraternities, all pledges must meet with, and get the signature of all of the current active members. Naturally, a brother could put any requirement or stipulations on getting said signature. I wanted to have some fun with this, so my requirement was pretty simple: "We have to do something together that you've never done before." I remember that a lot of these were quite fun, for instance Andrew had never had a cup of coffee so we went and got one. Josh had never been to Lazy Moon, so we did that. Will seems to have had the hardest time with this and put my "sig" off until the last. He told me he really couldn't think of anything... so I simply asked "Have I ever made you breakfast?" ..... then he says "That's what we'll do, you will make me breakfast." And so I did. :)

I remember later that Will told me that Matt came back to the apartment and told him that... he had to hear that story. A few weeks later I shared the story with Will.. and since then we've been pretty good friends... something about "I have a lot more respect for you now." haha.

                                                    Well the story of how Z and I met isn't anything special. I believe it all happened in the 1st grade when one of my childhood friends (aka Chase) introduced me to the new mexican on the block who had just joined our school, and after that all three of us became great friends. Now as for a funny story..... well i guess the best one i can think of off the top of my head is one from a day i was spending at Z's house when he lived with his grandparents. The day started off normal as ever Z and I where having a great time just fishing and playing godzilla on his super nintendo. when we decided to go try and catch this stupid six to eight inch bass that was taunting us by just floating in a foot of clear water right next to the dock we were fishing off of. We had tried basicly everything to get it to bite our hooks that were hanging right infront of its face when if finally decided to go into deeper water and stop taunting us, so after it left Z started fishing out in the deeper part of the creek while i went inside to get something (dont remember what) when all of a sudden i hear Z calling me saying he got a bite. Well i took off to see what he was catching..... unfortunitly for me i forgot THERES A GLASS DOOR BETWEEN ME AND HIM..... needless to say the door won and i ended up on my back thinking "oh yeah they have a sliding glass door." Z got such a kick out of it after he knew i was ok, but it was still funny that i lost to the door.

                                                    Will and I have been friends for probably 4 years now. I've lost count, which is a good thing because it means that he's become one of my closest friends and that renders time moot. As for how we met, I have KYX to thank for that. We were both Zetas and rushed the same semester. Even though I was significantly older than all but one of the other rushees, I developed strong ties to my fellow Zetas, especially Will. We were both huge fans of videogames, comics, and all things nerdy. Instafriends. I think we bonded most over 2 specific trips, an all-day trip to SuperCon down in Miami, and another week-long escapade that we took together with David, another groomsman, to North Carolina. Good times.

                                            <h3>Matt Furlong</h3>
                                            <h4>Groomsman</h4>
                                            <div class="description">

                                                Will & Matt. It only makes sense that these two names have the same letter order (consonant-vowel-double consonant), because these two people were meant to be together [Let’s ignore the fact that the name Jess also has the same feature].
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Like peanut butter and jelly, Will and Matt cannot be separated unless torn apart by the 30 pounds per square inch force that only a human temporal muscle can provide. Or an alligator. Alligator’s chew really hard.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                From the time Matt knocked on Will’s door in Pegasus Landing to give Will a bag of candy for visiting his church, Matt knew this was going to be something special. After finding their common ground of Halo and Rock Band over the next 9 months, these two young men took the big step that they knew was unavoidable; they moved in together. And by that I mean they got a three bedroom apartment in Oviedo Grove with another UCF student.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Over the two years that Matt and Will did life together in the Grove, memories were made, tears were shed and glory was found. Now that Matt and Will have both moved away from Orlando, their connection, although distanced, has not grown weak. They each look forward to a lifetime of exchanging picture messages of familiar, culinary images: a cup from TJ Flats, a bowl of delicious Cereal, and the front of a Sonny’s menu.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Matt, after having Will as a groomsman last year, is unbelievably excited for what he knows Will is about to experience. He wishes Will and his better half, Jess, the happiest of days for their wedding and the most blessed marriage and life together. Congratulations!

                                            It all started at Maggie Moo's...<br />
                                            I was so fortunate to meet Miss Jessica Katherine Collier upon her joining Theta Alpha Christian Sorority. During our 'signature week' (where all new members were to meet with current members in pursuit of finding a Big/Little relationship) we met at Maggie Moo's for ice cream and immediately connected! The Big/Little relationship is designed to be a discipleship to further grow in our faith with our sisters. I am blessed to have found such a wonderful Big/Little relationship with a foundation in our faith. I am beyond blessed to have established a friendship throughout all of this, and even more blessed to call Jessica my best friend. Immediately upon meeting we hit it off! Jessica has always been someone to encourage me and keep me laughing with her quick sass. I could not be more overjoyed that Jessica has been blessed with such a wonderful man in her life. The relationship they have is joyful and glorifying to the Lord-- they are a wonderful example to follow and great friends to have! I am so grateful to be a member of the wedding party, and even more so to be standing next to my best friend on her big day. I love you Jessica and William!

                                        I remember that fateful day well. It was the first night of Theta Alpha’s fall 2009 Rush week at UCF when I first had the opportunity to hug on that sweet, angelic, dimple-faced cutie; It’s a shame we couldn’t let Will rush though. JUST KIDDING! I am of course referring to the lovely Jessica Collier, and yes, I specifically remember thinking, “this is a dimple-faced cutie”. I digress. A friendship quickly formed between us and we made the decision to become roomies the next year! This is when Jessica and I became more than just friends. She became a sister, a comforter, an encourager, a prayer partner, and most importantly of all, a Real Housewife of New Jersey watcher. My fondest memories took place in that apartment and I will always treasure the tears and the laughter that occurred both inside and outside those walls. Will and Jess are both such dear friends of mine and I am beyond excited to celebrate their marriage. God has an amazing plan for these two and I cannot wait to see how He uses their marriage to bless the people around them. ZAVALA 2013!!

                                        Jessica and I met the second week of my freshman year at UCF when I joined Theta Alpha. Soon she was making me dress up as a peculiar looking Oreo and she became my big! I can't these past three years without her friendship and compassion. A while ago, the Theta Alpha retreat was a camping-type trip. Camping is hardly my forte, so Jessica and I were joking about getting "sick" to avoid going. Much to my surprise, I actually became incredibly sick right before the retreat. She brought me ice cream, which became the majority of my meals until I was healthy again. Throughout the time I've known Jess, there have been so many fun times and so many Sweet cupcakes! I've been so blessed to be able to call such a loving and wonderful person my friend!

                                        I have known Jessica since sophomore year, and it has been a blast since then! I have so many memories it’s hard to choose. She was always there for me through thick and thin, and I did my best to do the same. Any time we are together I feel like all we do is laugh! It may be simple, but one of my favorite memories was from one night when we took a late night adventure to the beach. They had just redone the playground and, of course, we turned into little kids on the spot. The night was full of laughter, dancing, ungraceful acrobats, crazy pictures, and solid memories that we both cherish.  I wouldn’t change one thing about that night, nor any time we have spent together. She has been the bestest friend anyone could ask for, as I am sure all who’ve gotten to know her can agree.  
                  Jess, you are such an amazing person. I don’t know if my life would have been half the adventure it was if I had never known you. For that, I thank you to no end. Love you girl!

                                        When you are around Jessica it is literally impossible for you not to dream. Her enthusiasm for life and her love for people are contagious. It has been such blessing to call her a friend and dream big with her. Starting She’s the First UCF with her has been an adventure of a lifetime and I cannot wait to see where our next adventure will take us.
